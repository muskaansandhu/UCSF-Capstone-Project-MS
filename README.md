# UCSF-Capstone-Project-MS

For M.Sc. Capstone project, I worked with Dr. Jessica de Leon, Dr. Thomas Hoffman, and Dr. Isabel Elaine Allen. My project worked with data from the [de Leon Lab](https://deleonlab.ucsf.edu) at UCSF, which focuses on the role that bilingualism plays in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. This GitHub repository contains several products from the project, including some code, the final presentation, and a technical manuscript that describes the project in detail.
