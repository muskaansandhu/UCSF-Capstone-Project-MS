# UCSF-Capstone-Project-MS

For M.Sc. Capstone project, I worked with Dr. Jessica de Leon, Dr. Thomas Hoffman, and Dr. Isabel Elaine Allen. My project worked with data from the [de Leon Lab](https://deleonlab.ucsf.edu) at UCSF, which focuses on the role that bilingualism plays in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. This GitHub repository contains several products from the project, including the code used to run the models, the final presentation, and a technical manuscript that describes the project in detail.
